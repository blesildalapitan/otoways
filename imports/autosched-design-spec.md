Design a modern, clean, and professional web-based vehicle service appointment system called AutoSched USING THESE, ESPECIALLY WITH HTML LANGUAGE. 

Technology Stack:

PHP

HTML

AutoSched is a system that allows customers to schedule vehicle maintenance and repair services online while enabling service staff and administrators to manage appointments, customer information, and service records efficiently.

The interface should be user-friendly, responsive, and suitable for desktop web applications.

Use a minimal automotive-themed design with a professional color palette:

Primary Color: Dark Blue (#1E3A8A)

Secondary Color: Gray (#F3F4F6)

Accent Color: Orange (#F97316)

Text: Dark Gray / Black

Clean white background

Typography should look modern and readable (similar to Inter or Poppins).
